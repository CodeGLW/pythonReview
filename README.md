# pythonReview
I'm reviewing basic python stuff since it's been a while haha. 
I'm tackling the lessons from this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8. It's a great 1-hour overview about basic Python stuff. 
I've taken a few years of coding in school, but I never found it that fun (since doing things via school sucks the fun out of everything). So, here's my way of starting over, relearning, and reclaiming my old flame for the ol' snake

:)

Update: as of 7/21 at 12:14 AM, I have finished!! Woo-hoo!!! I definitely needed to brush up on some of these skills. You *know* coding is fun when you start to jot down notes for future projects (like a program that determines which friend I should talk to). I'm really finding my happiness again. Oh and I have my basic skills back, which is cool
