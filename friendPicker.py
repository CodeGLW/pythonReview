# make a program that calculates which friend I should start a conversation with
# closer friends are more likely to be picked than others
# have a way to confirm that I want the friend it chose or have the option to rerun
# if I do talk to the friend, their value is decreased
# this data will be stored in a file that I can write over later to keep continuity
